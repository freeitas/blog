## What are Docker Security Benchmarks?

Docker security benchmarks are standardized guidelines and best practices for securing Docker containers and their environments. These benchmarks help organizations assess and improve the security posture of their Docker deployments.

## CIS Docker Benchmark

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Docker containers.

Key areas covered:

- Host configuration
- Docker daemon configuration
- Docker daemon configuration files
- Container images and build files
- Container runtime
- Docker security operations
- Docker Swarm configuration

## Docker Bench Security

Docker Bench Security is an automated script that checks for dozens of common best practices around deploying Docker containers in production.
