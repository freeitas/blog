## Why do we need a communication model?

- **Agnostic applications**
  - Without a standard model, your application must have knowledge of the underlying network medium
  - Imagine if you have to author different versions of your apps so that it works on wifi vs ethernet vs LTE vs fiber
- **Network Equipment Management**
  - Without a standard model, upgrading network equipment becomes difficult
- **Decoupled Innovation**
  - Innovations can be done in each layer separately without affecting the rest of the models

## What is the OSI Model?

- 7 Layers each describe a specific networking component
- Layer 7 - Application - HTTP/FTP/gRPC
- Layer 6 - Presentation - Encoding, Serialization
- Layer 5 - Session - Connection establishment, TLS
- Layer 4 - Transport - UDP/TCP
- Layer 3 - Network - IP
- Layer 2 - Data link - Frames, Mac address Ethernet
- Layer 1 - Physical - Electric signals, fiber or radio waves

## The OSI Layers - an Example (Sender)

Example sending a POST request to an HTTPS webpage:

- **Layer 7 - Application**
  - POST request with JSON data to HTTPS server
- **Layer 6 - Presentation**
  - Serialize JSON to flat byte strings
- **Layer 5 - Session**
  - Request to establish TCP connection/TLS
- **Layer 4 - Transport**
  - Sends SYN request target port 443
- **Layer 3 - Network**
  - SYN is placed in IP packet(s) and adds the source/dest IPs
- **Layer 2 - Data link**
  - Each packet goes into a single frame and adds the source/dest MAC addresses
- **Layer 1 - Physical**
  - Each frame becomes string of bits which converted into either a radio signal (wifi), electric signal (ethernet), or light (fiber)

_Take it with a grain of salt, it's not always cut and dry_

## The OSI Layers - an Example (Receiver)

Receiver computer receives the POST request the other way around:

- **Layer 1 - Physical**
  - Radio, electric or light is received and converted into digital bits
- **Layer 2 - Data link**
  - The bits from Layer 1 are assembled into frames
- **Layer 3 - Network**
  - The frames from layer 2 are assembled into IP packet
- **Layer 4 - Transport**
  - The IP packets from layer 3 are assembled into TCP segments
  - Deals with Congestion control/flow control/retransmission in case of TCP
  - If Segment is SYN we don't need to go further into more layers as we are still processing the connection request
- **Layer 5 - Session**
  - The connection session is established or identified
  - We only arrive at this layer when necessary (three way handshake is done)
- **Layer 6 - Presentation**
  - Deserialize flat byte strings back to JSON for the app to consume
- **Layer 7 - Application**
  - Application understands the JSON POST request and your express json or apache request receive event is triggered
