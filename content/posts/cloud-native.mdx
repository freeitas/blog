> "Cloud Native" refers to an approach to application development and deployment that takes full advantage of the characteristics and benefits of cloud computing. Cloud computing offers on-demand resources, scalability, flexibility, and efficiency, and "Cloud Native" applications are specifically designed to operate in this environment.

 I've been diving deep into cloud-native security lately, and thought I'd share what I'm learning. 

What are the 4 C's?
The cloud-native security model is often visualized as concentric layers, with each "C" representing a crucial security domain:

+ Code - The innermost layer (your applications)
+ Container - The packaging of your code
+ Cluster - The orchestration of your containers
+ Cloud - The infrastructure everything runs on

Each layer builds upon the security of the inner layers; protecting one layer does not guarantee the previous layer. But also It does not matter if my code is secure if my container is a Swiss cheese of breaches

Code
-
+ Dependency scanning
+ SAST/DAST (Static/Dynamic Application Security Testing)
+ Secrets management
+ Secure coding practices

Container
-
+ Container image scanning
+ Runtime security
+ Container hardening
+ Base image security

Cluster
-
+ Network policies
+ Pod security standards
+ RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
+ Admission controllers
+ Secrets management

Cloud
-

+ IAM (Identity and Access Management)
+ Network security
+ Data encryption
+ Compliance frameworks
+ Infrastructure security

I'll be posting deep dives into each of these layers as I study them.
