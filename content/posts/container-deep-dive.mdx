## What is a container?

A container is a standardized unit of software that packages code and all its dependencies so that software can run quickly and consistently in any environment.

characteristics:

- immutability
- isolation of processes and computing resources
- lightweight, runs as a process on the operating system

container vs virtual machine:
Virtual Machines (VMs):
Each VM runs a complete operating system, including the kernel, and uses a hypervisor to manage multiple VMs on the same hardware. This results in higher resource consumption, longer startup times, and less efficiency in terms of memory and CPU usage.
Containers:
Share the host operating system's kernel, isolating only the application and its dependencies. This makes them significantly lighter, allowing for more efficient use of resources and almost instantaneous startup. Containers are ideal for scenarios that require rapid scalability and high density of applications on a single host.
