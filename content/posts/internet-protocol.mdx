## IP Address

- **Layer 3 property**
- Can be set automatically or statically
- Network and Host portion
- 4 bytes in IPv4 - 32 bits

## Network vs Host

- a.b.c.d/x (a.b.c.d are integers) x is the network bits and remains are host
- Example 192.168.254.0/24
- The first 24 bits (3 bytes) are network the rest 8 are for host
- This means we can have 2^24 (16,777,216) networks and each network has 2^8 (255) hosts
- Also called a subnet

## Subnet Mask

- 192.168.254.0/24 is also called a subnet
- The subnet has a mask 255.255.255.0
- Subnet mask is used to determine whether an IP is in the same subnet

## Default Gateway

- Most networks consist of hosts and a Default Gateway
- Host A can talk to B directly if both are in the same subnet
- Otherwise A sends it to someone who might know, the gateway
- The Gateway has an IP Address and each host should know its gateway
